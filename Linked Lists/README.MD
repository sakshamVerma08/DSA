# Linked Lists

## Overview

The "Linked Lists" folder contains a collection of code implementations and practice problems focused on singly and doubly linked lists. This section of the repository is designed to help users understand and master the concepts and operations related to linked lists, which are fundamental data structures in computer science.

## Contents

### Practice Problems

- **[revisionProblems.cpp](C:\Coding Stuff\DSA\Linked Lists\revisionProblems.cpp)**: This file contains practice problems related to singly linked lists. These problems were particularly challenging and are included here to provide a comprehensive understanding of various operations and scenarios encountered with singly linked lists.

- **[revisionProblems2.cpp](C:\Coding Stuff\DSA\Linked Lists\revisionProblems2.cpp)**: This file focuses on practice problems involving doubly linked lists. Similar to the singly linked list problems, these exercises were challenging and are intended to deepen your understanding of doubly linked list operations and complexities.

### Additional Implementations

- **Basic Operations**: Implementations of basic linked list operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Advanced Problems**: Solutions to more complex problems like palindrome checks, merging lists, and sorting linked lists.
- **Doubly Linked List Operations**: Specific operations and challenges related to doubly linked lists, including insertion and deletion at various positions.

## Usage

To explore the linked list implementations and practice problems, navigate to the desired file within this folder. Each file is self-contained and includes comments to explain the logic and approach used.
